# pymol_methods


Since python 3,  scripts used prior for mapping in pymol don't work...instead install pymol version 2.5 in a conda environment:

              conda create -n test_pymol -c tpeulen -c conda-forge pymol-open-source
              conda activate test_pymol
              conda install -c conda-forge pmw # if don't have pmw already for py2.7
              pymol
